	/* The purpose of this program is to simulate a movie theater that runs movies at a ticket price of $6.99.
	 * It asks the user for the retailer of the prepaid gift card that they will use to pay as well as the amount on the card.
	 * It then informs the user how many tickets they are able to buy with the funds and the remaining money they would have if
	 * they bought the maximum amount of tickets.
	 * It asks the user to enter the amount of tickets they would like to buy.
	 * It finishes by displaying the total price and asking the user to enter the date of purchase.
	 * A receipt is then printed displaying the date, the cost of the tickets, and the remaining money on the prepaid card.

a)  The first algorithm is of exponential complexity as it calls itself more than two times in a
	single recursive call. Those calls can each also cause several recursive calls making it grow exponentially.
	
	The second algorithm is of linear complexity because it only calls itself once per recursive call, which results
	in less calls overall. The additional use of an array that holds all the terms makes it so that the call stack
	isn't overwhelmed by being called for every single term.
	
b)	Yes, both use tail recursion as the recursive call is done at the end of each recursion step.
